# VCO-Design-45nm-180nm
"Voltage-Controlled Oscillator design with 180 nm and 45 nm schematic simulations."
## Overview
This project demonstrates the design of a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) using 5 inverters, resistors, and capacitors to introduce propagation delay. Buffers in the feedback loop are used to stabilize the delay. The design is simulated for both 180 nm and 45 nm technology nodes.

## Schematics
Below are the schematic images of the VCO design for both 180 nm and 45 nm technology nodes:
